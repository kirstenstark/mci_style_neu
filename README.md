# mci_style_neu: R Scripts for EEG Data Analysis

Hosts code for data analysis for an EEG language comprehension experiment with two experimental factors: semantics (semantically intuitive vs. semantic violation vs. minimally counterintuitive) Ã— context narrative style (normal vs. fairytale). All code is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org) using the [eeguana](https://github.com/bnicenboim/eeguana) package.

[Scripts](Scripts) contains the raw R scripts; [Scripts/Output](Scripts/Output) contains rendered reports of the scripts including the R output.
